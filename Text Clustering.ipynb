considering setting up other schemes in similarly rural areas.\"],[\"Local net TV takes off in Austria\",\"Mr Fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved

people out of cash, steal valuable data or take over home PCs.\"],[\"Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\",\"Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer.\"],[\"Rich

thieves\",\"Before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines.\"],[\"Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\",\"But many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.\"],[\"Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\",\"\\\"You cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to,\\\" said Pete Simpson, head of the threat laboratory at security firm Clearswift.\"],[\"Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\",\"Now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms, or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments.\"],[\"Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\",\"\\\"It's about outright criminality now,\\\" said Mr Simpson, explaining why this change has come about.\"],[\"Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\",\"He said many of the criminal programs came from Eastern Europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of

transparent.\"],[\"Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\",\"\\\"The main motivation now is money,\\\" said Gary Stowell, spokesman for St Bernard software.\"],[\"Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\",\"Mr Stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high.\"],[\"Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\",\"With almost any phishing or spyware attack, criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover.\"],[\"Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\",\"So-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends, to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites.\"],[\"Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\",\"In some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on PCs it infects and then trying to erase them so it

another big innovation that won't just see a change in our mobile phone habits - it might alter the way we listen to the radio.\"],[\"Mobiles get set for visual radio\",\"Finnish handset giant Nokia
