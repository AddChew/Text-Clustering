Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves,Instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code.,25
Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves,The growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs.,22
Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves,Before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines.,24
Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves,But many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.,18

Mobiles get set for visual radio,"One problem is that the name Visual Radio leads people to think of television but Reidar Wasenius, a senior project manager at Nokia, was adamant that Visual Radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium.",37
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"He said: ""I'm very happy to say it's not television, what we're talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today.",24
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"""If you have a Visual Radio enabled handset, when you hear an artist you don't know, or there's a competition or vote that you'd like to participate in, you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on-air broadcast you've just been listening to.""",53
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"That visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station, and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to.",29
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"As well as details on the track or artist of a particular song, there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself, in a similar way to digital television's ""red button"" content.",36
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"Possible interactive content includes competitions, votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing.",17
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"But the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations, who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a real-time basis.",32
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"This in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue, as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners.",28
Mobiles get set for visual radio,As the Visual Radio content is transmitted by existing GPRS technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network.,22
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"And there will be a cost for the service as well, although it may depend on your usage.",18
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"""If you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it'll be two or three pounds per month,"" said Mr Wasenius.",20
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"""But typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an 'all you can eat' arrangement per month.""",22
Mobiles get set for visual radio,The payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dial-up connections.,17
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"One thing that is for sure - assuming that Nokia retains its market share in handsets, it is estimating that there will be 100 million Visual Radio-enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of 2006.",33
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"""Basically, Visual Radio is not really revolutionary, but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before.""",29
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"The first Visual Radio service in the UK will begin in a few months time with Virgin Radio, who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners.",30
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"Station manager Steve Taylor commented: ""Listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way.",16
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"""Not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like; mp3 music downloads and the latest gig tickets.""",30
Mobiles get set for visual radio,"Initially Visual Radio functionality will be limited to two Nokia handsets due out soon - the 3230 and 7710 - but if successful, it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them.",31

Cable offers video-on-demand,"Satellite customers without PVR cannot pause, rewind or fast forward their programmes.",12

Cable offers video-on-demand,"""We offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both video-on-demand and PVR,"" he said.",21
Cable offers video-on-demand,Video rental stores may also have to watch their back.,10

Cable offers video-on-demand,NTL said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering a PVR but for the moment is concentrating on video-on-demand.,21
Cable offers video-on-demand,"""PVR is a recording mechanism whereas what we are offering is truly on demand,"" said a spokesman for the company.",20
Cable offers video-on-demand,"Video-on-demand has the added advantage of not requiring a separate set-top box or extra remote controls, he added.",18
Cable offers video-on-demand,"Adam Thomas, an analyst at research firm Informa Media believes the time is ripe for video-on-demand to flourish.",18
Cable offers video-on-demand,"""While Sky will remain the dominant force in UK pay TV for some time to come, NTL and Telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of VOD enthusiasm and, if marketed correctly, this could help them eat into Sky's lead,"" he said.",45
